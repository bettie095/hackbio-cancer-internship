## Title: Gene Expression Analysis and Functional Enrichment of Differentially Expressed Genes in Glioblastoma Cells‚Äù

## Background
Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and aggressive malignant brain tumor in adults. It arises from astrocytes, cells that support neurons. GBMs are fast-growing, invasive tumors that make up about half of all malignant CNS cancers, posing significant treatment challenges.

The molecular and genetic basis of glioblastoma must be understood because of the disease's severe nature and the difficulties in treating it. This project aims to enhance our understanding of glioblastoma through three key objectives. First, we will perform differential gene expression analysis to identify significantly upregulated and downregulated genes, highlighting potential therapeutic targets. Second, we will conduct functional enrichment analysis to uncover key biological pathways involved in the disease, revealing gene interactions that drive progression. Finally, we will utilize data visualization techniques, such as heatmaps and lollipop plots, to effectively present gene expression levels and pathway analysis results.

## Conclusion 
This analysis will reveal notable genes with differential expression in glioblastoma and the biological pathways linked to tumor progression, contributing valuable insights for future therapeutic strategies.
