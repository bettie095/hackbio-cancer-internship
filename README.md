#Differential gene expression (DGE)

Is the process where different genes are activated in a cell, giving that cell a specific purpose that defines its function. Differential gene expression analysis is an RNA-seq technology where the gene expression of cells is evaluated, quantified, and compared. DGE analysis determines which genes are actively being expressed, how often those genes are being expressed, and which genes are silenced. Running a DGE analysis on cells from individuals with certain medical conditions, like cancer, may help elucidate what causes cancer and how to treat it1.

#Upregulation 

Upregulation refers to the increase in gene expression levels  in a particular condition, leading to higher production of its corresponding protein. In cancer, upregulation of certain genes may drive oncogenesis by promoting cell proliferation, inhibiting apoptosis, or enhancing metastatic potential. For example, the gene HER2 is upregulated in some breast cancers, leading to aggressive tumor growth. The discovery of HER2 upregulation has not only led to a better understanding of breast cancer biology but also to the development of targeted therapies like trastuzumab (Herceptin), which specifically inhibits HER2 and improves patient outcomes2. 

#Downregulation 

Downregulation refers to a decrease in gene expression. In cancer, downregulation of tumor suppressor genes can remove critical checks on cell growth, facilitating unchecked proliferation. Example is the mutation of the TP53 gene, which encodes the p53 protein, often termed the "guardian of the genome." When TP53 is downregulated or mutated, cells can evade apoptosis, leading to tumor development and progression3.

#Biomarkers 

Biomarkers are vital in healthcare as they provide valuable insights into disease diagnosis, prognosis, treatment response, and personalized medicine. They also guide treatment decisions by predicting disease outcomes and facilitating individualized treatment plans. Advanced techniques such as RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) have revolutionized differential expression studies. RNA-seq allows for the identification of novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets.
Conclusion, understanding differential gene expression is critical in cancer research. It enables the identification of key drivers of cancer and facilitates the discovery of biomarkers that can revolutionize cancer diagnosis and treatment.
